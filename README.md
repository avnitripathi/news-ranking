This project tackles media echo chambers by clustering news sources and recommending a diverse spread. The steps involved are below:

1. Scrape politics headlines from popular UK news sites.
2. Cluster these news sites using NLP-based tools.
3. Recommend based on a 3rd-party reliability rating of these news sites.

A video explaining this process is below.
